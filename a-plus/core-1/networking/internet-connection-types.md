# Internet Connection Types


## Fiber (FiOS)

[FiOS (Fiber Optic Service)](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/FiOS-Fiber-Optic-Service) is a [fiber to the premises](https://www.techtarget.com/searchnetworking/definition/fiber-to-the-home) (FTTP) telecommunications service offered by Verizon to consumers in the United States. The word "fios" is Irish for "knowledge" and the FiOS acronym is a trademark of Verizon. FTTP, also called "fiber to the home" (FTTH), is the installation and use of [optical fiber](https://www.techtarget.com/searchnetworking/definition/fiber-optics-optical-fiber) from a central point directly to individual buildings.

Fiber optic communications is one of the more expensive type of internet connections that comes with a great amount of bandwidth. Download speeds range from 10 to 50 Mbps, and upload speeds can run up to 20 Mbps. You can get up to gigabit, and sometimes even beyond depending on the area. It is available in certain areas, and some of them are not available in certain areas. 

## Cable

When we talk about cable, we're talking about the [coaxial cable](https://www.techtarget.com/searchnetworking/definition/coaxial-cable-illustrated) type implementations, when it comes to network communications. Coaxial cables are probably one of the oldest network technologies, we have in the industry today. 

A coaxial -- or coax -- cable is primarily used by cable TV companies to connect their satellite antenna facilities to customer homes and businesses. Telephone companies also sometimes use coax cable to connect central offices to telephone poles near customers. They use a technology called DOCSIS; [Data-over-Cable Service Interface Specifications](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/tech/broadband-cable/data-over-cable-service-interface-specifications-docsis/index.html) which defines technical specifications for equipment at both subscriber locations and cable operators' headends. Adoption of DOCSIS accelerates the deployment of data-over-cable services and will ensure interoperability of equipment throughout system operators' infrastructures.

## Dial-up

The [public switched telephone network](https://www.techtarget.com/searchnetworking/definition/PSTN), or PSTN, is the world's collection of interconnected voice-oriented public telephone networks. PSTN is the traditional circuit-switched telephone network. PSTN comprises all the switched telephone networks around the world that are operated by local, national or international carriers. These networks provide the infrastructure and services for public telecommunication.

This is the system that has been in general use since the late 1800s. It's the aggregation of circuit-switching telephone networks that has evolved from the days of Alexander Graham Bell. Using underground copper wires, this legacy platform has provided businesses and households alike with a reliable means to communicate with anyone around the world for generations. Today, it is almost entirely digital. 

Modern dial-up modems typically have a maximum theoretical transfer speed of **56 kbit/s** (using the V. 90 or V. 92 protocol), although in most cases, 40–50 kbit/s is the norm. Factors such as phone line noise as well as the quality of the modem itself play a large part in determining connection speeds. Dial up is still in use in areas where there aren't cables that can be run. Whether isn't maybe the ability to for whatever reason or another, have satellite. When your other network connections get hit with natural disasters dial up is used in disaster recovery.

## DSL

[DSL (Digital Subscriber Line)](https://www.cisco.com/c/en_uk/solutions/routing-switching/dsl.html) is a modem technology that uses existing telephone lines to transport high-bandwidth data, such as multimedia and video, to service subscribers. DSL provides dedicated, point-to-point, public network access which gives you this ability to use the telephone and the internet at the same time. It also allows for a lot greater speeds than dial-up. 

The speeds that DSL gets is directly related to the distance from the telecommunication providers switch. DSL has a maximum distance of around 18,000 feet. The further away you are with the switch, more likely the slower your connection is gonna be.

## Cellular

A cellular network or mobile network is a telecommunications network where the link to and from end nodes is wireless and the network is distributed over land areas called cells, each served by at least one fixed-location transceiver (typically three cell towers or base transceiver stations). This particular technology does rely on different cell towers and they're spaced apart. So hopefully what happens is you can actually continue to drive and not drop that connection, that actually seems like a big drop at all. Now with that though, that is not the farthest in other words that's not the longest distance type of connection that we have with. 

## Satellite

Most satellite internet services come from single geostationary satellites that orbit the planet at 35,786 km. As a result, the round trip data time between the user and satellite—also known as latency—is high, making it nearly impossible to support streaming, online gaming, video calls or other high data rate activities. It also suffers from conditions such as weather.

## Wireless Internet service provider (WISP)

Fixed [wireless internet service providers](https://www.wispa.org/what_is_a_wisp.php) (WISPs) deliver reliable, affordable broadband to customers in fixed locations such as residences, businesses, and schools.

Fixed wireless is the fastest-growing sector of the broadband industry, characterized by cost-effective deployment, rapid technology innovation, and continuously evolving transmission models, including fiber. Networks can be built and upgraded virtually overnight at a fraction of the cost of wired-only or satellite technologies.
