## Copper

Copper-based network media is  the most prevalent media type network cable type that we have in the industry today, and it's one that's been around for a very long time. You will see it pretty much everywhere from enterprise level networks to the most commonly residential network areas. 

These are the cables that send electrical communications across networks, and they come with a series of standards and specifications for usage.

Inside [twisted pair cabling](https://www.techtarget.com/searchdatacenter/definition/twisted-pair) are **eight copper conductors twisted into four pairs**. What those twists do inside of your cable is they increase its immunity to electromagnetic interference to protect against electromagnetic interference in any kind of unwanted signal. These are:

- [UTP](https://www.techtarget.com/searchnetworking/definition/Unshielded-Twisted-Pair): helps minimize electronic interference by providing balanced signal transmission
- [STP](https://www.techtarget.com/searchnetworking/definition/shielded-twisted-pair): helps protect occupants and equipment from the dangers of high voltage and shock

### RJ45

[RJ45](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/rj45-color-code/) is a widely used and most common wired internet connection interfaces. It is available in two standards i.e. **T568A** and **T568B.** each of these works as pin IN and pin Out for ethernet cable to perform data transfer. the only difference between these two cables is the wiring of green and orange pairs.

#### T568A Color code standard

## Plenum vs. non-plenum

[Plenum and non-plenum cables](https://www.wilsonamplifiers.com/blog/plenum-vs-non-plenum-cable/) can be any type of cable – coaxial, Ethernet, HDMI, fiber optic, etc. The term “Plenum” and “Non-Plenum” simply refers to the [outer jacket/cover that protects the cable](https://blog.siemon.com/infrastructure/safety-first-know-your-cable-jacket-ratings).

Plenum-rated cables, also known as CMP (Communications Multipurpose Plenum), have the highest flame rating and the highest cost. They're covered with a low-smoke polyvinyl chloride (PVC) or fluorinated ethylene polymer (FEP) fire-retardant jacket. The jacket is designed to [restrict flame propagation within 5 ft](https://www.belden.com/blogs/digital-building/communications-cable-ratings/), reduce the amount of smoke and toxic fumes released, and self-extinguish in the event of a fire. Thus, fire and building safety codes mandate plenum-rated cables be used in plenum spaces and air ducts. They can also be used in non-plenum areas.

Non-Plenum cables, on the other hand, are much cheaper and not as fire-resistant. When burned, they release toxic fumes such as [hydrochloric acid and dioxin](https://computersnationwide.com/when-is-plenum-cable-required/). Therefore, they may not be used in plenum areas. Otherwise, deadly gas will rapidly circulate through the building. The two most common non-plenum cables are riser-rated cable or CMR (Communications Multipurpose Riser) and CM (Communications Multipurpose).

|CMP|CMR|CM|
|--- |--- |--- |
|Most fire resistant|Less fire resistant|Least fire resistant|
|Made for plenum airspaces, but can be installed anywhere|Mostly used for risers and vertical applications, but can also be used in non-riser spaces|For general use, or areas without fire code restrictions on cable types|
|Low-Smoke PVC or FEP Jacket|PVC Jacket|PVC Jacket|
|Releases a lower level of toxic fumes when burned|Releases a higher level of toxic fumes when burned|Releases a higher level of toxic fumes when burned|
|Most expensive|Less expensive than CMP|Cheapest|

## Specifications (Specs)

[TIA is the Telecommunication Industry Association](https://tiaonline.org/about/) and they are the company and standards body, that's endorsed by the [American National Standards Institute](https://www.ansi.org/about/introduction) that defines the electrical capabilities of these cables. 

|Cable Type|Shielding|Maximum Frequency|Max Data Rate|Speed|

### Category-3

Cat3 cable is an earlier generation of cable, which supports a maximum frequency of 16 MHz. This cable may have 2, 3, or 4 copper pairs. Cat3 type of Ethernet cable is still used for two-line telephone systems and 10BASE-T networks. It is also used for alarm system installation or similar kinds of applications.

### Category-5

These cables are slower compared to modern-day hardware requirements. So, you should use this type of Cable only if you have older hardware that demands outdated hardware.

### Category-5e

Cat5e is one of the most popular cabling types of an ethernet cable used for deployments because of its ability to support Gigabit speeds at a cost-effective price.

Cat 5e can support up to 1000 Mbps speeds, which is flexible enough for small space installations. Therefore, it is widely used in residential areas. Cat5e is one of the least expensive cabling options available in the market.

### Category-6

Cat6 cabling support up to 10 Gbps and frequencies of up to 250 MHz. These types of cables are more tightly twisted and feature two or more twists per centimeter. It only supports 37-55 meters when transmitting 10 Gbps speeds.

### Category-6a

Cat6a ethernet cable supports bandwidth frequencies of up to 500 MHz. Cat6a cabling is thicker compared to Cat6, making it less flexible. That is why it is more suited for industrial environments at a lower price point.

### Category-7

Cat7 has the ability to transmit up to 40 Gb at 50 meters and 100 Gb at 15 meters. This type of ethernet cable offers extensive shielding to decrease signal attenuation. It is relatively stiff in comparison to previous generations of cabling.

Cat7 type of Cable is suited for use in Datacenters and large enterprise networks. However, Cat7 has not been approved as a cable standard for telecommunications.

### Category-8

Category 8 cable is designed for operations of up to 2000 MHz. CAT8 cables work with 25/40GBASE-T Gigabit Ethernet; this reduces power consumption and is designed for bandwidth-intensive data center applications.

This type of Cable is ideal to use where the distances between units are short. CAT8 cables are backward compatible with previous Categories of ethernet cables.

## Coaxial

[Coaxial Cable](https://www.techtarget.com/searchnetworking/definition/coaxial-cable-illustrated) is a standard for 10 Mbps Ethernet cables. These types of cables consist of an inner copper wire cover with insulation and another shielding. It has a plastic layer that offers insulation between the draided metal shield and center conductor. Coaxial cabling has a single copper conductor in its center.

Types of Coaxial Cable are 1) RG58 2) RG8 3) RG6 4) RG59

|Coaxial Cable Type|Outside Diameter (Metric)|Outside Diameter (Imperial)|Usage|
|--- |--- |--- | --- |
|RG-58|4.95mm|0.195"|RG-58 Coaxial Cables are a type of cable that forms an essential component in many electronic systems and networking installation applications. They offer excellent signal integrity and low signal loss, making them suitable for long-haul communication links.|
|RG-59|6.15mm|0.242"|RG-59 is a 75 Ohm coax cable best used for CCTV, audio video, and other low-frequency applications. They are flexible and easy to install. Though, they are not meant for long runs.|
|RG-6|6.90mm|0.275"|RG-6/U is a common type of coaxial cable. It has an impedance of 75 Ohm. It's used in a wide variety of residential and commercial applications, including cable television, home internet, and more.|
|RG-62|6.15mm|0.242"|RG-62 Coaxial Cables are a type of cable that has been designed for carrying high frequency electromagnetic signals over long distances, owing to its high degree of signal integrity and lower signal loss.|

|RG-12|14.10mm|0.555"|RG12 Coaxial Cables are a type of coaxial cable commonly used for high-frequency signal transmission in telecommunications and networking applications. They are designed to transmit radio frequency (RF) signals over longer distances while ensuring minimal signal attenuation. |

## Fiber

A [fiber-optic cable](https://www.verizon.com/articles/internet-essentials/fiber-optics-definition/) contains anywhere from a few to hundreds of optical fibers within a plastic casing. Also known as optic cables or optical fiber cables, they transfer data signals in the form of light and travel hundreds of miles significantly faster than those used in traditional electrical cables. And because fiber-optic cables are non-metallic, they are not affected by electromagnetic interference (i.e. lightening) that can reduce speed of transmission. Fiber cables are also safer as they do not carry a current and therefore cannot generate a spark.

- Fiber optics support a higher capacity. The amount of network [bandwidth](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-bandwidth-2625809) a fiber cable can carry easily exceeds that of a copper cable with similar thickness. Fiber cables rated at 10 [Gbps](https://www.lifewire.com/definition-of-kilobits-megabits-gigabits-817379), 40 Gbps, and 100 Gbps are standard.
- Because light can travel for much longer distances over a fiber cable without losing its strength, the need for signal boosters is lessened.
- A fiber optic cable is less susceptible to interference. A copper network cable requires shielding to protect it from electromagnetic interference. While this shielding helps, it is not sufficient to prevent interference when many cables are strung together in proximity to one another. The physical properties of fiber optic cables avoid most of these problems.
- Since no electricity is involved, fiber optic internet is less likely to shut down during a power outage than [other types of high-speed internet](https://www.lifewire.com/what-highspeed-internet-choices-are-available-2483358#fiber-internet). Along with being more reliable, fiber optic internet is also faster—and more expensive—than traditional internet cables.
- Cable technology currently supports approximately 1,000 Mbps of bandwidth, while fiber optic internet supports speeds of up to 2,000 Mbps. At 1,000 Mbps, you can download a 2-hour HD movie in about 32 seconds. At 2,000 Mbps, it takes approximately 17 seconds to download a 2-hour HD movie.
