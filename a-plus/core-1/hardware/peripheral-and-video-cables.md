# Peripheral and Video Cables

## USB

One of the most common methods of connecting peripherals to our computers is by using USB, or the universal serial bus if you’re connecting a mouse, a keyboard, a printer, or almost any other peripheral, you’re probably using USB. [One of the early versions of USB was USB 1.1](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-usb-1-1-2626036), and it had two different speeds. It had a low speed, which was 1.5 megabits per second and a maximum cable length of around 3 meters, and there was also a full speed version of USB 1.1, which supported 12 megabits per second over a maximum cable size of 5 meters.

[USB 2.0](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-usb-2-0-2626037) increased the total maximum speed to 480 megabits per second over the maximum 5 meter cable size. USB 3.0 is an upgrade to USB 2, and sometimes is referred to as super speed USB. It supports 5 gigabits per second over what usually is about a 3 meter cable. The USB 3.0 standard doesn’t specify a maximum cable length, but 3 meters is one that’s relatively common.

Some common connectors are:

- [USB Type A](https://www.lifewire.com/usb-type-a-connector-2626032): These connectors are technically called USB 2.0 Standard-A and are the perfectly rectangular USB connectors you'll find on most non-mobile devices. USB 2.0 Type A connectors are physically compatible with those from USB 3.0 and USB 1.1.
- [USB Type B](https://www.lifewire.com/usb-type-b-connector-2626033): These connectors are technically called USB 2.0 Standard-B and are square except for a small notch on top. USB 2.0 Type B plugs are physically compatible with USB 3.0 and USB 1.1 Type B receptacles but USB 3.0 Type B plugs are not backward compatible with USB 2.0 Type B receptacles.
- USB Micro-A: These connectors, especially the plugs, look like miniature versions of USB 2.0 Type A connectors. USB 2.0 Micro-A plugs are compatible with both USB 2.0 Micro-AB receptacles and USB 3.0 Micro-AB receptacles. However, newer USB 3.0 Micro-A plugs will not fit in USB 2.0 Micro-AB receptacles.
- USB Micro-B: These connectors are small and rectangular but two corners on one side are slanted instead of square. USB 2.0 Micro-B plugs are compatible with four receptacles: both USB 2.0 and USB 3.0 Micro-B and Micro-AB receptacles. Newer USB 3.0 Micro-B plugs are not backward compatible with either USB 2.0 Micro receptacle.
- USB Mini-A: These connectors are small and mostly rectangular with one very rounded side. USB 2.0 Mini-A plugs are only compatible with USB 2.0 Mini-AB receptacles.
- USB Mini-B: These connectors are small and mostly rectangular with noticeable indentations on the short sides. USB 2.0 Mini-B plugs are compatible with USB 2.0 Mini-B and USB 2.0 Mini-AB receptacles.

In recent years, the USB-C connector is becoming more common. You can send many different types of connections that are not only related to data, but you could also send video and other signals as well.

The USB-C connector is also quite small. You can see the standard-A plug on the right side, and the traditional micro-B plug on the left side. The USB-C plug is slightly larger than the micro-B, but not by much. And you can see that it is symmetric, so That it’s able to work with any orientation.

## Thunderbolt

[Thunderbolt technology](https://www.thunderbolttechnology.net/tech/faq) is a universal cable connectivity solution that offers 40 gigabits per second (Gbps) bandwidth for high-speed data and video transfer, while also charging your laptop2 over a single cable. It uses the same Type-C connector as other USB Type-C (USB-C) ports.

However, Thunderbolt 4 technology is much more than a USB-C connector. Thunderbolt brand certification mandates higher minimum performance and capabilities for cables, PCs, and accessories for greater reliability across devices and operating systems. As the most complete and highest standard of USB-C connections available on the market, Thunderbolt 4 technology is backwards compatible with its prior generation as well as millions of USB 3 and USB4 products.

## DisplayPort

A video format that’s been around for a very long time is the VGA type connector. That stands for Video Graphics Array. The connector itself is a DB-15, connector although technically that particular size is a DE-15, but very often we just refer to this as a DB-15 connector.

This connector is also a very unique blue color. That blue color is associated with VGA in the PC System Design Guide Standards. This is a standard that supports video displays, but it has no way to integrate audio signals within this video connection. So if you are connecting a monitor using a VGA connection and you need audio output, you’ll need to have a separate audio connection from that device.

Unlike some of our newer video standards, this VGA signal is an analog signal. So as you extend this VGA signal beyond 5 to 10 meters, you’ll see that the screen becomes fuzzier and more difficult to see as that signal degrades.

The VGA connector on the back of a computer is a 15 pin connector, and it’s a relatively unique connector. You don’t see other devices using this 15 pin connector. So whenever you see that connector type, you can automatically assume that’s a VGA connection.

A more modern type of video connection is the HDMI connector or High Definition Multimedia Interface. This is a digital connection that not only includes the video signal but can also incorporate audio within that same cable. It’s not unusual to see HDMI cables extending around 20 meters before you start to have dropout and other digital artifacts appear on the screen. This common type A connector that you most often see with HDMI is a 19 pin connector and it is a proprietary type specific to HDMI. The only time you’ll see this connector type being used is if you’re connecting to an HDMI interface.

Here’s the back of a video adapter. You can see that it does support HDMI output on this video adapter. This also supports DisplayPort interfaces DVI interfaces. We’ll look at those two types next.

DisplayPort is another video standard. It is a digital standard and is able to send packetized video and audio signals over these DisplayPort cables. There’s commonly two different types of DisplayPort interfaces you might see. The standard DisplayPort interface is shown here, and there’s a smaller mini DisplayPort interface that can also be used. If you’re using the larger DisplayPort interface, you’ll notice that there are hooks connected to this particular interface that lock that into place. So you can’t simply pull it out of a DisplayPort interface. You’ll need to push down on a release mechanism and then it can easily be removed from that DisplayPort interface.

DisplayPort is also passively compatible with HDMI. So if you have a computer with a DisplayPort interface and a monitor with an HDMI interface, you simply need a cable that has DisplayPort on one side and HDMI on the other and the compatibility between those two allows them to work perfectly.

Here’s a video adapter that has an HDMI output and DisplayPort outputs as well. You can see that the DisplayPort interfaces are shaped to be slightly different than the HDMI. This video card also has a DVI connector at the top as well and there are many types of DVI interfaces.

DVI stands for Digital Visual Interface. And there are many different types of interfaces in the DVI family. These allow you to send video signals over what we call single link and dual link. A single link connection supports 3.7 gigabits of throughput, which allows us to view definition television at 60 frames a second. Dual link connections have effectively twice as much throughput and allow us to view HD television at 85 frames per second.

DVI is a video connection only and does not pass any audio signals through the DVI connection. DVI supports both analog and digital connections. You can see an example of the DVI-A or analog connector here at the top. But there are also DVI-D or digital connections in here as well. You might even have a DVI-I, which is an integrated connection which allows for both digital and analog communication in the same connector. Here’s the end of a DVI cable. This happens to be a DVI digital cable on a single link connection, and that would connect to a corresponding interface on your video adapter card.
