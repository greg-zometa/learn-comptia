## Battery

Two major considerations to keep in mind are cooling and battery life for a laptop to operate.

- Nickel Cadmium ([Ni-Cd](https://www.google.com/search?q=pronunciation+nicad))
	- Obsolete, suffered from [memory effect](https://www.google.com/search?q=memory+effect+in+batteries), and too expensive to maintain.
- Nickel Metal Hydride (Ni-MH)
	- Suffered less from memory effect, required less maintenance, and have twice the charging capacity.
	- Still had memory effect and maintenance issues.
- Lithium Ion (Li-ion)
	- Much less, if none, memory effect issues, more charging capacity, and a longer battery life.
	- They ignite easily ðŸ˜ŸðŸ”¥

Ensure that the battery types match the laptop that is being used.

## Keyboard/keys

![Keyboard keys](../../assets/keyboard-keys.png)

[Laptop keyboards have a connector to the motherboard](https://youtu.be/GUzBWFqTKwM?t=193).  Be cautious as some keyboards may be part of the case (holds and protects internal components).

## Motherboard

![Motherboard](../../assets/motherboard.png)

Motherboards are extremely proprietary. Integrated or [embedded systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embedded_system) allow a combination of systems, CPUs, RAM, I/O devices, to be a part of a larger electronic system making it costly to replace (if damaged may have to replace all), yet efficient to use in a hardware space.

[Cooling systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_cooling) remove excessive heat from the motherboards components. The fan and thermal pipe are part of the cooling system.

## RAM

![Random Access Memory](../../assets/ram.png)

Think of [RAM](https://www.google.com/search?q=what+is+the+purpose+of+ram) as a caching layer for the hardware to fetch resources during your current session very quickly.

Be aware of the difference between static RAM([SRAM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_random-access_memory)) and dynamic RAM ([DRAM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_random-access_memory)) along with the 5 types of [SDRAM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synchronous_dynamic_random-access_memory).

## Disk drives

![Disk drive](../../assets/disk-drive.png)

[SSDs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid-state_drive) use semiconductor cells.

[HDDs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_disk_drive) are hard disk drives.

## Wireless cards and antenna

![Wireless card](../../assets/wireless-card.png)

[Wireless cards](https://premioinc.com/blogs/blog/what-is-a-wireless-card-and-how-does-it-work) enable internet connection under the coverage of a wireless local area network. They transmit data through radio waves frequency wirelessly.

## Webcam and microphone

![Webcam](../../assets/webcam.png)

[Modern webcams and microphones are built into the laptop](https://youtu.be/-qrjiBy_SyA?t=25).

## Backlight Inverter

Backlight inverters power/illuminate the display of a monitor. They are commonly used in LCD panels. They are not needed in LED/OLED displays.
